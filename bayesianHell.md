# Bayesian Hell

## 15/06/2024

Why it not being causal  
How would I want to tell  
Piecing up a shit story  
That I am doing well  
Hard to sell  

With all the elements  
Derive all the sentiments  
Inhale less particles  
Control more variables  

Now I learned to hate the world  
There is no way the prior works  
No one tried to be the first  
Pretend to be dumb but not a coward  

Too much layers, too thick  
Finding hard to breath, stick  
Or is it my asthma  
Or is it just toxic  

Strolling down a narrow path  
Gods quarreling about the stars  
Figuring out about figures  
Fermented emotion triggers  

Puting up a single line  
Normalizing all the time  
Oh I struggle in posterior war  
No one knew what I saw  
What a pathetic remorse  

People mountain people sea  
Clever boi found the key  
With those left ugly parts  
Probably no restarts   

Probably in Bayesian Hell  
Always inside a Bayesian well
