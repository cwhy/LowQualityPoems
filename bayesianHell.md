# Bayesian Hell

## 15/06/2024

How it not being causal  
How would I want it tell  
Piecing up a shit story  
That I am doing well  
Hard to sell  

With all the elements  
Derive all the setiments  
Inhale more particals  
Control more variables  

Now I learned to hate the world  
There is no way the prior works  
No one want to be the first  
Pretend to be dumb but not coward  

Too much layers, too thick  
Finding hard to breath  
Or is it my asthma  
Or is it just toxic  

Strolling down a narrow path  
Gods quarreling about stars  
Figuring out about figures  
Fermented emotion triggers  

Puting up a single line  
Normalizing all the time  
Oh I struggle in posterior war  
No one knew what I saw  
What a pathetic remorse  

People mountain people sea  
Clever boi found the key  
With those left ugly parts  
Probably no restarts   

Probably in Bayesian Hell  
Always in a Bayesian well
