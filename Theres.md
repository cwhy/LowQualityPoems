# Breathe in, Breathe out
## Nov 2021

There's no way to be miserable  
from some people it's an actionable  
Burnt soul desiring something logical 
for some people it's somewhat magical  

Pain  
reactionary disdain  
The nonexistent suffering  
Escaping towards entropy  
Broken control plane  
rushing to explain  

tormenting reflection  
ad hoc detection  
post hoc correction  
far away from realization
normal regression  
as an addiction  

Breathe, hoping, yesterday  
overreacting mood swing
problematic questioning  
faraway and terrifying  

From the other side  
what a relaxed guy  
cake is nice  
mind to share a slice?  

The killer is strong  
singing victory song  
"The waving flag"  
"the bright winter sun"  
nothing wrong  
to sing along  
left a bleeding heart  
with faint beating sound  

I'll be walkin'  
Still luckier than Hawking  
all the road signs passin'  
not a slight doubtin'
