# Damn Purple

## 27 Aug 2021 A resting Friday

Nice chilling music, damn

turining blue into green

Graduated highschool in my dream, man

still not over the show


No you have no chances for a Jazz star, god

nor a poet splitting romance

Enjoy the fan part,

and learn to taste for fun


Funny how it is

Knowing after burnt

Facing neverending thirsty heart, bro

Life ain't musical



True

Just like all things,

which are rarely purple
